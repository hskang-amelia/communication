/// For method as rust side does not have any varadic function argument support,
/// we are having tuple of arguments, so we can have any number of arguments (currently up to 8) without any extra boilerplate.
/// we have implemeted blanket implementation of MethodArgs, MethodArgsAllocate and
/// MethodCallInput traits for all supported arities (0–8 arguments) using `impl_all_arities!` macro in this crate.
/// This blanket implementation help in design to have any number of arguments
/// (currently up to 8) without runtime specific implementation for each arity.
/// This crate provides the necessary traits and types to support method calls in a communication API,
/// including handling of method arguments, allocation of uninitialized argument,
/// and invocation of methods with both copy and zero-copy semantics.
///
/// We want to follow the same semantics for method like c++ provide for method call,
/// and because of that we have added few supporting traits which help to create similar semantics for method call in rust side.
/// In the event and field we have `SampleMut` with that allocated memory can call send,
/// but in method call we can not use that approach as we do not have any common API to call send/update,
/// Method takes the argument whether it is by value or by zero-copy in same method function/method,
/// because of that we have added `invoke_with_copy` and `invoke_zero_copy` methods in MethodCaller trait.
/// Which is not user facing APIs but used by interface macro and supporting traits.
///
/// trait details:
/// `MethodHandler`: Producer side registration of method handlers,
/// this needs to be implemented by runtime for producer side method handler registration.
/// `MethodCaller`: Consumer side caller of methods, this needs to be implemented by runtime for consumer side method calls.
/// This trait provides methods for invoking methods with both copy and zero-copy semantics,
/// also handles allocation of uninitialized method arguments for zero-copy calls,
/// this is user facing API for consumer side method calls.
/// This trait is used by the interface macro to generate consumer methods for each interface method and
/// invoke the runtime specific method caller implementation.
/// `MethodInArgMaybeUninit`: This is the uninitialized type for a single method argument,
/// it is used in the zero-copy method call path.
/// `MethodInArgAllocator`: This is for runtime-specific method argument allocation,
/// it is used in the zero-copy method call path.
/// Which provide the allocate API for specific argument type and
/// return the uninitialized method argument type for that argument type.
/// `MethodReturnSample`: This is a trait for the return value of a method call on the consumer side,
/// it is used to provide `Deref<Target = T>` access to the return value,
/// `MethodInArgPtr`: This is a trait for the pointer type for a single method argument,
/// it is used in the zero-copy method call path.
/// `ZeroCopyArgs<P>`: Newtype wrapper for the zero-copy dispatch, returned by `MethodInArgMaybeUninit::write()`
///
/// Now below traits are marker / marker-like (because it is implemented for all supported arities) traits and
/// which no need to implement by runtime because blanket implementation is added in this crate.
///
/// `MethodArgs`: Marker trait for method argument tuples,
/// no need to implement by runtime because blanket implementation is added in this crate.
/// `MethodArgsPtrTuple`: Maps an Args tuple to the matching ZeroCopyArgs-wrapped pointer tuple for a given runtime R,
/// this is used to provide the PtrTuple type for the zero-copy call path,
/// it is a separate trait from MethodArgs because pointer types are runtime-specific.
/// `MethodArgsAllocate`: Maps an Args tuple type to the matching uninitialized method argument tuple for a specific runtime allocator A,
/// this is used to produce the uninitialized method arguments for zero-copy method call path.
/// `MethodCallInput`: Unified input for a method call accepted by the interface macro-generated consumer methods,
/// this is used to dispatch the method call to the appropriate runtime specific method -
/// caller implementation based on the type of the input arguments.
/// `MethodHandlerCall`: Callable handler function for a method with Args inputs and Return output,
/// this is used to register the handler function for a method on the producer side,
/// which can be a plain closure or any FnMut with the matching signature,
/// and it will automatically satisfy this trait,
/// so that the interface macro can generate the necessary code to register the handler function for each interface method on the producer side.
///
/// We have method_arities_macros.rs which is used to generate the blanket implementation of MethodArgs, MethodArgsAllocate and
/// MethodCallInput traits for all supported arities (0–8 arguments) are provided in this crate.
/// This macro also extend the `Reloc` and `CommData` traits for all supported arities (0–8 arguments) are provided in this crate.
/// Macro invocation happen in same file so no need to invoke from user side or runtime side.
/// Also we can not depend on `interface_macros` because this macro code expand in library crate and interface macro is used in user crate,
/// and library should be build before user crate, so we can not depend on that.
